This is a search engine for knowledge; not just for websites, or images, but for exploring entire systems of thought. Iâ€™ve worked on Spectra for over 22 years collaboratively with another designer, slowly conceptualizing and iterating.<br/><br/>
            Nothing is one thing, but rather a sum of its parts. Spectra aims to emulate that essence. No idea or concept exists in a vacuum separate from all other concepts, but rather is intertwined with others in order to exist. Spectra aims to let users explore that by focusing on three things: visualization, navigation, and organization.<br/><br/>
            For my senior capstone, I developed an early version of Spectra.
